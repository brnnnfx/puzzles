Hey I'm Bren 👋 I'm a big nerd in many ways. This repo is to record my progress for puzzles I play for learning and to develop new skills. Specifically, I use this to:
- motivate myself to contiously learn by recording my accomplishments
- get practical experience providing some transparency in how I think and manage a repo
- learn how to automate different processes

Please open an issue if you:
- Find a mistake
- Have a suggestion for improving how I use this repo
- Know of a puzzle game I might like
